# mssql-mcp

A .NET-powered Model Context Protocol server for MSSQL.

## Abstract

Why does this exist? Because the other MCP solutions in market for this are written are generally janky pieces of shit that don't work - certainly not on Windows.

## Security Disclaimers

This software is licensed under Apache 2.0 and is available "as is" - this means that if you turbo-nuke your database because you gave an AI agent `sa` access through this MCP server, we're not responsible.
